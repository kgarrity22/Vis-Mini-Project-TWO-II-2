    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <p>       
        After choosing our dataset, we came up with a number of questions that we wanted to answer. These questions are listed
        below:
        Are cats or dogs the more popular pet in the US?
        Are there more dogs or more cats in the US?
        What state has the highest concentration of cat owners?
        What state has the highest concentration of dog owners?
        Is there a particular part of the country that prefers dogs over cats or vice versa?
        Do most people in the US own either a cat or a dog?
        What is the average number of cats and dogs per household in the US?
    </p>


    <h1>Processing</h1>
    <p>
        The next step for us was to clean and process this data set. Luckily for us, the data presented was already very clean,
        but we did need to do some processing in order to best answer some of our lingering questions. We created additional
        columns using SQL commands and if statements. These additional columns included “percent pet household” and “percent
        non-pet household,” which held the data for the percentage of households in the U.S. that owned and did not own pets
        respectively. We also created a new data table column called “cat or dog” which stated whether the state of that row had
        a majority dog population or a majority cat population. Additionally, we found a dataset with state abbreviations and
        the positions for where marks should be displayed to create a visualization that would take the shape of a map of the
        U.S. We left joined this dataset with the cats and dogs dataset in order to have all our data in one place.

    <h1>Exploration</h1>
    <p>
        During the exploration process we started out very broad by considering whether or not households even owned pets to
        begin with. From there we were able to refine our questions by observing how cat and dog populations varied by state. 
        In order to compare state data, we had to then look at the number of cats or dogs owned in each household. We created
        11 worksheets that contained bar graphs, bubble charts, maps, and pie charts. Here is an example of how we chose a graph
        to answer the question, "Is there a particular part of the country that prefers dogs over cats or vice versa?"

        bar chart with categorical data - mid atlantic vs. NE etc. -> no it's better to have what looks like the US

        **notes
        switch main map data from cat/dog population to the mean data - answers regional question, swap tooltip vis and bottom
        right chart.
        turn on filter for bottom right mean bar chart for both cat/dog data
        the cat/dog specific maps show percentages out of all households. should we consider only talking about pet-owning households?
        per 1000 -> in 1000s
        some labeled averages are not averages

    <p>
        Our first step in completing this project was choosing a data set. To do this, we looked at various collections of
        public data sources but decided to use a data set from Tableau Public because of how well organized and interesting the
        data sets offered there were. The data set that piqued our interest the most was a data set called “Cat vs. Dog
        Popularity in the US.” After having a raucous and lively debate about whether cats or dogs are better, we decided that
        we wanted to investigate this issue and use this data to create our visualization.

        <a href="https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources?qt-overview_resources=1#qt-overview_resources">Here</a> is our main data source.

                <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
                <div class="textboxes">
                    <p>
                        While the topic of our project may not be the most ground breaking or influential subject, the lessons we learned were
                        enumerable. Firstly, coming together as a group to choose a project idea was no easy task. We scrolled through many
                        different data sets debating on the overarching theme, the applicability of the data, our own individual interests in
                        the topic, and with each topic came personal opinions that all needed to be satisfied. When working with a team, it is
                        important to understand that each person needs to have interest in project. If even just one member does not care about
                        the idea, then the final outcome will reflect that – we are only as strong as our weakest link!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once we chose the topic that appeased and interested us all – the age-old debate of cats vs. dogs- we could begin the
                        thought process to craft the visualization. Here is another lesson learned: iterations are necessary! As seen above, we
                        went through many different design iterations in order to figure out which one best reflected our data, and most easily
                        delivered our message – there is clear divide in the US over cats vs. dogs. We also were able to learn more, at least on
                        the surface level, about the US population through such a simple facing question. For example, does New York prefer cats
                        over dogs because it is much easier to own cats in places such as NYC? We truly were able to see how data is the lines
                        of text in a storybook, and the visualizations are the beautiful images that tie the whole story together. It is not
                        very often in Computer Science courses here at BC that we are able to sit down and craft stories – but with this project
                        we were able to draft, propose, edit, and publish our very own.
