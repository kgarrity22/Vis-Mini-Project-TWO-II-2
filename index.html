    <h1>Data Selection</h1>

    <p>
        Our first step in completing this project was choosing a data set. To do this, we looked at various collections
        of
        public data sources but decided to use a data set from Tableau Public because of how well organized and
        interesting the
        data sets offered there were. The data set that piqued our interest the most was a data set called “Cat vs. Dog
        Popularity in the US.” After having a raucous and lively debate about whether cats or dogs are better, we
        decided that
        we wanted to investigate this issue and use this data to create our visualization.

        <a href="https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources?qt-overview_resources=1#qt-overview_resources">Here</a> is
        our main data source.

    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <p>
        After choosing our dataset, we came up with a number of questions that we wanted to answer. These questions are
        listed
        below:
        Are cats or dogs the more popular pet in the US?
        Are there more dogs or more cats in the US?
        What state has the highest concentration of cat owners?
        What state has the highest concentration of dog owners?
        Is there a particular part of the country that prefers dogs over cats or vice versa?
        Do most people in the US own a pet?
        How many cats does the average household have? , dogs?
        What is the average number of cats and dogs per household in the US?
    </p>


    <h1>Processing</h1>
    <p>
        The next step for us was to clean and process this data set. Luckily for us, the data presented was already very
        clean,
        but we did need to do some processing in order to best answer some of our lingering questions. We created
        additional
        columns using SQL commands and if statements. These additional columns included “percent pet household” and
        “percent
        non-pet household,” which held the data for the percentage of households in the U.S. that owned and did not own
        pets
        respectively. We also created a new data table column called “cat or dog” which stated whether the state of that
        row had
        a majority dog population or a majority cat population. Additionally, we found a dataset with state
        abbreviations and
        the positions for where marks should be displayed to create a visualization that would take the shape of a map
        of the
        U.S. We left joined this dataset with the cats and dogs dataset in order to have all our data in one place.

    <h1>Exploration</h1>
    <p>
        During the exploration process we started out very broad by considering whether or not households even owned
        pets to
        begin with. From there we were able to refine our questions by observing how cat and dog populations varied by
        state.
        In order to compare state data, we had to then look at the number of cats or dogs owned in each household. We
        created
        11 worksheets that contained bar graphs, bubble charts, maps, and pie charts. Here is an example of how we chose
        a graph
        to answer the question, "Is there a particular part of the country that prefers dogs over cats or vice versa?"

        bar chart with categorical data - mid atlantic vs. NE etc. -> no it's better to have what looks like the US

    </p>

    <p>
        One question we wanted to answer from this data was which state has the most dogs and which state has the most cats. To
        answer this, we originally thought that displaying this as a bar chart would be effective. When we displayed this data
        in a bar chart, we realized that having two bars for every state was very cluttered and difficult to read. However,
        displaying the data this way did lead us to a discovery; when looking at the bars, we realized that states with bigger
        populations were generally going to have higher dog and cat populations. This information is very intuitive and
        therefore not very interesting. While we still thought this information could be important, we did not want it to be the
        main focus of our visualization, so we decided to display this data as a bubble chart on the side of the dashboard.

    </p>

    <p>
    The previous exploration led us to realize that something more interesting to discover would be which state has the
    highest concentration of cats and dogs. Because we wanted to understand the number of cats and dogs relative to the
    number of households in that state, we used percentages. We decided that this data was important and enlightening, as it
    tells us which states and areas of the country are home to the most dog owners. We chose to display this data as a
    hex-map of the U.S. with a color gradient representing the percentage of the population who were dog or cat owners in
    the second two pages of the visualization.

                During the exploration process we started out very broad by considering whether or not households even
                owned pets to
                begin with. From there we were able to refine our questions by observing how cat and dog populations
                varied by state.
                In order to compare state data, we had to then look at the number of cats or dogs owned in each
                household. We created

                <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
                <div class="textboxes">
                    <p>
                        While the topic of our project may not be the most ground breaking or influential subject, the lessons we learned were
                        enumerable. Firstly, coming together as a group to choose a project idea was no easy task. We scrolled through many
                        different data sets debating on the overarching theme, the applicability of the data, our own individual interests in
                        the topic, and with each topic came personal opinions that all needed to be satisfied. When working with a team, it is
                        important to understand that each person needs to have interest in project. If even just one member does not care about
                        the idea, then the final outcome will reflect that – we are only as strong as our weakest link!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once we chose the topic that appeased and interested us all – the age-old debate of cats vs. dogs- we could begin the
                        thought process to craft the visualization. Here is another lesson learned: iterations are necessary! As seen above, we
                        went through many different design iterations in order to figure out which one best reflected our data, and most easily
                        delivered our message – there is clear divide in the US over cats vs. dogs. We also were able to learn more, at least on
                        the surface level, about the US population through such a simple facing question. For example, does New York prefer cats
                        over dogs because it is much easier to own cats in places such as NYC? We truly were able to see how data is the lines
                        of text in a storybook, and the visualizations are the beautiful images that tie the whole story together. It is not
                        very often in Computer Science courses here at BC that we are able to sit down and craft stories – but with this project
                        we were able to draft, propose, edit, and publish our very own.
